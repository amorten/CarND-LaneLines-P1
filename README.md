# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This is the first project in Udacity's Self-Driving Car NanoDegree program. I use Canny edge detection and a Hough transform to find lane lines in videos of highway driving (including the optional Challenge video that has varying degrees of light, shadow, and road color).  All of the code is found in the IPython notebook 

[P1.ipynb](P1.ipynb).

As part of the project I created a write-up,

[writeup.md](writeup.md),

that describes my pipeline for detecting lane lines in an image. In the writeup I also describe potential shortcomings and possible improvements.

For completeness I have included the original README for this project provided by Udacity as

[README_Udacity.md](README_Udacity.md)
